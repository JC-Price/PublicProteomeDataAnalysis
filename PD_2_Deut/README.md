This is README is for PD_2_Deut.py

Created by Yi Jie(Josh) Tseng on 11/14/2023

Purpose:
This script was created to convert the PD output to deuterater compatible. 

Because I was in a hurry,
so this script is not fully optimized. 

Requirements:
1. aa_elem_compositions.tsv
2. aa_labeling_sites.tsv



Usage:
To use this script, simply pass the PD peptide output to this script:
python PD_2_Duet.py <file_name>

It will output a ID.csv file in the same folder as this script.
